This is project "OpenMagnifier" - a project helping visibly impaired people. 
The program currently runs under Ubuntu Linux 13.04 and just works with an
attached "Logitech HD Webcam C615". But it will be extended soon. It was optimized 
for operation with a numerical keyboard (see using.txt).

Prior of running OpenMagnifier the package "v4l-utils" hast to be installed:

`sudo apt-get install v4l-utils`
